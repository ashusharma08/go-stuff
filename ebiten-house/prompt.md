Overview:
We are creating a game using ebitengine. Name can be decided later. This game is a mix of first person shooting and sandbox.
Basic idea is, User should be allowed to create their own map, which comprises of Buildings, roads, tress and other flora and fauna. Users can design the architecture and interior of building they are going to defend. Then they can play a first person shooting game where they defend the house against multiple waves of attack.

What all do we need:
1. Map genenator
    - User gets a blank screen. He can add roads, sidewalks, buildings (houses, schools, etc etc), flora and fauna, vehicles etc.
    - User should be able to save and load maps for future use.
2. Weapons:
    - Lets start with a gun (pistols, ARs, SMGs etc) and melee weapons (knife)
    - Throwables and traps can be added later
3. NPCs:
    - Attackers that will attack. 
4. Game engine:
    - Engine is responsible for attacks. Smart enough to break user's design and do maximum damage.

## Storyline
User will create a map. Once created, it will be ready to use. Each location will have a entry point(s). 
Enemies attack from those entry points only.
Scoring is done based on damage to the life and infrastructure.
