# House
I was once playing COD. A thought popped up in my head. What if, instead of using random maps, i could create my own map. 
What's the point? Basically, we all had those thoughts sitting in classroom, what if there was a terrorist attack. How would i save everyone.
Yeah, so essentially simulating those fantasies.
PS: House is a FPS game (or just a shooter game. First person can be done later)

## What all do we need
### Game modes
Lets start with only one mode where people attack from different positions. What all weapons to support? Is it one time attack or in waves?
### A map generator
User gets a blank screen. He can add roads, sidewalks, buildings (houses, schools, etc etc), flora and fauna, vehicles etc.
<li>Should be able to save and load maps.</li>

### Movable components
User, and then attackers etc. 
### Weapons (and traps?)
What kind of weapons do we support? Gun, SMG, AR, MG? Trap part is just extra.
### Game engine
Engine is responsible for attacks. Smart enough to break user's design and do maximum damage.


## Storyline
User will create a map. Once created, it will be ready to use. Each location will have a entry point(s). 
Enemies attack from those entry points only.
Scoring is done based on damage to the life and infrastructure. 

## How to get started
<ol>Start with creating various individual movable (humans, animals etc) and static (buildings, trees, roads etc) components.</ol>
